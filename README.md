# NAN Protocol 🚀

NAN Protocol is a gamified mining experiment built on the Solana Blockchain.
It rewards users for daily engagement with a deflationary mechanism and luck-based incentives.

## 👁️ The Vision

In a crypto world obsessed with speed and quick flips, NAN Protocol is an experiment in **patience and consistency**.
We believe that true value is built over time, not overnight. This protocol is designed to reward users who show up every day, enforcing a slow, orderly distribution of tokens rather than a chaotic rush.

**"No rush. Just order."**

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Daily Mining:** Users can mine NAN tokens once every 24 hours.
* **Glitch Mechanic:** Every 33 days, a system glitch triples the rewards (x3 multiplier).
* **Halving Logic:** Rewards decrease as the total supply grows, ensuring scarcity.
    * Phase 1: 333 NAN
    * Phase 2: 166 NAN
    * Phase 3: 83 NAN
    * Phase 4: 1 NAN (Final dust)
* **Total Supply:** Capped at 333,000,000 NAN.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Blockchain:** Solana (Devnet)
* **Smart Contract:** Rust (Anchor Framework)
* **Client:** TypeScript
